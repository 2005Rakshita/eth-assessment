PROJECT TITLE 

Create a token

Here the code provides the ability to create token that contain the details like Token name, Token Abbrv. and Total Supply, and a mapping of address to uint name as balance as well as two function as follow,
1) min function: it takes the two paramenter address and a value and add the value to total supply and the address of the balance.
2) burn function: it works opposite to the mint function and delete the value from total supply and a balance of sender.
and to use solidity we have to install remix ide or we can use it online by visiting the website remix.ethereum.org it works same as VS code.
