PROJECT TITLE 

Create a token

Here the code provides the ability to create token that contain the details like Token name, Token Abbrv. and Total Supply, and a mapping of address to uint name as balance as well as two function as follow,
1) min function: it takes the two paramenter address and a value and add the value to total supply and the address of the balance.
2) burn function: it works opposite to the mint function and delete the value from total supply and a balance of sender.
and to use solidity we have to install remix ide or we can use it online by visiting the website remix.ethereum.org it works same as VS code.

/*
       REQUIREMENTS
    1. Your contract will have public variables that store the details about your coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply)
    2. Your contract will have a mapping of addresses to balances (address => uint)
    3. You will have a mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. 
       The function then increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance 
       of the “sender” address by that amount
    4. Your contract will have a burn function, which works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. 
       It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It will then deduct the value from the total supply 
       and from the balance of the “sender”.
    5. Lastly, your burn function should have conditionals to make sure the balance of "sender" is greater than or equal 
       to the amount that is supposed to be burned.

    function mint(address adr, uint value) public {
       tokens.total_supply+=value;
       balance[adr]+=value;
    }
    // burn function
    function burn(address adr, uint value) public {
       tokens.total_supply-=value;
       balance[adr]-=value;
    }
